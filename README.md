# Bouncing Balls

Bouncing Balls is a very basic JS game I made in order to try out ES6 class syntax and destructuring in an actual project.

The objective of the game is to navigate the blue ball to avoid being hit by a red ball. A new red ball is added to the screen every second.

A live version of the game can be found here: [Live Version](https://andthomas.github.io/bouncing-balls/)

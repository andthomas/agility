# Agility

Agility is a very basic JS game I made in order to try out ES6 class syntax and destructuring in an actual project.

In the process I developed a really smooth set of controls using the arrow keys. 

The objective of the game is to navigate the blue cube to avoid being hit by a red cube. A new red cube is added to the screen every second.

A live version of the game can be found here: [Live Version](https://andthomas.github.io/bouncing-balls/)
